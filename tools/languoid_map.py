"""Static distribution maps for the record pages under dist/<family>/.../<language>/.

Each map is a small inline SVG: the shared background dist/map/land.svg
(drawn by build_land.py) is referenced with <use>, so it is downloaded once
and cached, and each page adds only its own points. The map works without
JavaScript; dist/map-zoom.js adds zoom and pan, and draws the 1:10m tiles
(dist/map/tiles/) over this background for the part in view.

Projection: Web Mercator (the projection of most web maps), cut at
MAX_LAT north and south, so the whole world is a square WORLD_W wide.
The map repeats to the east and west: the background is drawn once more on
each side, so a view may cross the 180th meridian, and dist/map-zoom.js
lets a visitor drag around the world without end. x = SCALE * longitude in
radians; north is up (y grows downwards, as in SVG).

Points are Glottolog's representative coordinates (one per record). They are
not the area where a language is spoken.
