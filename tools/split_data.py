"""Split the atlas data into small files the browser can load quickly.

dist/data.json (21 MB) and dist/integrated.json (9 MB) stay as downloads,
but the pages no longer load them. Instead this script writes, under
dist/data/:

- atlas.json: everything the atlas needs to draw the tree and search by
  name, Glottocode and ISO code. Glottolog records are stored as columns,
  and values the browser can recompute are left out (each record's id,
  children, root and size, the Glottolog assertions and the placements
  index). dist/atlas-data.js rebuilds the original objects from it.
- names/<n>.json: the recorded names and spellings of each record, split
  into SHARDS files by a hash of the id (see shard()). A page loads one
  only when it shows a record's names.
- search.json: the text of all recorded names, for search. The atlas loads
  it after the tree is shown.

The WALS genus lists in data.json ("wals", "walsRoots" and each record's
"wals") are not used by any page and are left out.

Run after prepare_static.py. check() rebuilds the objects the same way
the browser does and fails if anything differs from the originals.
