"""The site name, the owner's profile link and the copyright line: one place for each.

Every page title ends with TITLE_SUFFIX, and "yoshi" in the header links to
PROFILE_URL (the owner's title rule: research-aide .claude/rules/titles.md and
.claude/rules/titles.md here). The page generators (tools/build_home.py,
tools/build_paths.py) write them from here. The hand-written pages in dist/
carry the same text: `--check` (run by tools/build_site.sh) fails if one of
them differs, and `--write` rewrites their "by yoshi" link from here.

dist/lang.js switches the profile link to the interface language by changing
the language part of the link's own address, so it keeps no copy of
PROFILE_URL; dist/record.js keeps the title suffix its page was built with.
